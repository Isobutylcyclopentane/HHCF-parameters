# HHCF-parameters
"""
This is a small project for helping the Physics Department at school to analyze the 
surface of certain super-lattice in a more effortless fashion. It takes the Height-height 
correlation function data from an AFM observation as a .txt file, and extract the three 
crucial parameters for a self-affined surface, the RMS roughness, the lateral roughness 
and the local roughness. It requires the processed image data from Gwyddion.

This program requires external libraries: numpy, scipy and matplotlib 

It contains 12 helper functions and 1 main function;
