This is a small project for helping the Physics Department at school to analyze the surface of certain super-lattice in a more effortless fashion. It takes the Height-height correlation function data from an AFM observation as a .txt file, and extract the three crucial parameters for a self-affined surface, the RMS roughness, the lateral roughness and the local roughness.

# This requires the processed image data from Gwyddion.
# This program requires external libraries: numpy, scipy and matplotlib

# THIS PROGRAM IS NOT FULLY OPTIMIZED AT ALL, and will be continuously updated

It contains 12 helper functions and 1 main function;
